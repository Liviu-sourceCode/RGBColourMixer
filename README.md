# RGB Colour Mixer

## Project Overview
The **RGB Colour Mixer** project was developed as part of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Bra»ôov. It combines both electronics and programming concepts acquired through laboratory exercises and coursework. The project was built on a breadboard and includes:

- An RGB LED
- 3 potentiometers
- 3 resistors
- A button
- A 16x2 LCD display
- An Arduino Uno

## Main Features
- **RGB LED Control**: The project allows manipulation of the intensity of each color channel (Red, Green, Blue) of the RGB LED using the potentiometers.
- **Intensity Display**: The LCD screen displays the intensity percentage of each color channel.
- **Button Functionality**: The button controls the ON/OFF state. The intensity of the LED is adjustable only when the button is in the ON position, with the LCD showing specific messages based on the button's state.

## Components and Setup
- **Arduino Uno**: The microcontroller used for managing the RGB LED and interfacing with the other components.
- **Breadboard**: Used for prototyping and assembling the circuit.
- **RGB LED**: Allows control of the color output by varying the intensity of red, green, and blue.
- **Potentiometers**: Used to adjust the intensity of each color channel.
- **Resistors**: Protect the components and ensure proper functioning.
- **Button**: Toggles the ON/OFF state of the RGB LED.
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Shows the intensity percentages and button status messages.

## Learning Outcomes
This project provided valuable learning experiences and insight into working with development boards and electronics. It enhanced understanding of LED control, analog input handling, and LCD interfacing. The project has sparked a desire to tackle increasingly complex projects in the field of development boards and electronics.

## How to Use
1. **Assemble the Circuit**: Connect the RGB LED, potentiometers, button, and LCD to the Arduino Uno on the breadboard according to the provided schematic.
2. **Upload the Code**: Load the Arduino sketch to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Power the Circuit**: Ensure that the Arduino Uno is powered and observe the behavior of the RGB LED and LCD display.
4. **Adjust Potentiometers**: Rotate the potentiometers to change the intensity of the RGB LED colors.
5. **Toggle the Button**: Press the button to switch between ON and OFF states and view the corresponding messages on the LCD.
